# Welcome to Express Football Game! ‚öΩÔ∏è

Hey there! üëã Welcome to the `express-football-game` repository. This project is all about creating a fun and interactive football game application using some of the best technologies out there. We're excited to have you here!

## The Tech Behind the Magic üé©

This application is crafted with love using:

- **Express**: One of the most popular Node.js frameworks that helps us build our server-side logic effectively.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: We use EJS to generate our HTML markup. It gives us the power of JavaScript within our HTML templates.
- **TypeScript**: To make our JavaScript even better, we use TypeScript. It's like JavaScript but with superpowers (like static typing!).
- **CSS**: Good old CSS is our choice for styling the game interface. It's all about making the game look good and feel good to play.

## How to Jump In üèä

Want to get this game running on your computer? No worries, it's simple:

1. **Clone the repository**: First things first, clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Install the dependencies**: We have a few dependencies you'll need to install. Just run `npm install` and you'll be good to go.
3. **Time to play**: Want to see the game in action? Run `npm run dev` and open your favorite browser to `localhost:3000`. You'll see our game live and ready for action.
